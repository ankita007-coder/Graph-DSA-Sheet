### Overview:
This code is designed to find all critical connections (bridges) in an undirected graph. A critical connection is an edge that, if removed, will make some nodes unreachable from others.

### Code Breakdown:
#### 1. Initialization:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._timer = 1  # Initialize a timer to assign discovery times to nodes
```
- The `Solution` class is initialized with a `_timer` variable to keep track of the order in which nodes are visited.

#### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS) Method:
```python
    def _dfs(self, node, parent, adj, vis, low, tin, bridges):
        vis[node] = 1  # Mark the current node as visited
        low[node] = tin[node] = self._timer  # Set the discovery time and low value to the current timer value
        self._timer += 1  # Increment the timer for the next node

        for neighbor in adj[node]:  # Loop through all the neighbors of the current node
            if neighbor == parent:
                continue  # Skip the parent node to avoid going back

            if vis[neighbor] == 0:  # If the neighbor hasn't been visited yet
                self._dfs(neighbor, node, adj, vis, low, tin, bridges)  # Recursively visit the neighbor
                low[node] = min(low[node], low[neighbor])  # Update the low value of the current node

                # If the lowest reachable vertex from neighbor is higher than discovery time of current node
                if low[neighbor] > tin[node]:
                    bridges.append([node, neighbor])  # Add the edge to the bridges list
            else:
                low[node] = min(low[node], tin[neighbor])  # Update the low value if the neighbor is already visited
```
- `vis[node]` marks the node as visited.
- `low[node]` and `tin[node]` are both set to the current value of `_timer`.
- The `_timer` is incremented to reflect the discovery of a new node.
- The method loops through each neighbor of the current node:
  - Skips the parent to avoid backtracking.
  - If the neighbor is not visited, it recursively calls `_dfs` for the neighbor.
  - Updates the `low` value of the current node based on the neighbor's `low` value.
  - If the `low` value of the neighbor is greater than the discovery time of the current node, it identifies a bridge.
  - If the neighbor is already visited, it updates the `low` value of the current node based on the neighbor's discovery time.

#### 3. Main Method to Find Critical Connections:
```python
    def criticalConnections(self, n, connections):
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]  # Create an adjacency list for the graph
        for u, v in connections:
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)  # Populate the adjacency list

        vis = [0] * n  # Create a visited list to keep track of visited nodes
        low = [float('inf')] * n  # Initialize low values for all nodes
        tin = [float('inf')] * n  # Initialize discovery times for all nodes
        bridges = []  # List to store the bridges

        for i in range(n):  # In case the graph is disconnected, run DFS from each node
            if vis[i] == 0:
                self._dfs(i, -1, adj, vis, low, tin, bridges)  # Start DFS from node i

        return bridges  # Return the list of critical connections
```
- Initializes the adjacency list, `vis`, `low`, and `tin` arrays.
- Fills the adjacency list with the given connections.
- Ensures all nodes are checked by running DFS from each unvisited node (handles disconnected graphs).
- Returns the list of bridges (critical connections).

### Summary:
- **Initialization:** Sets up the timer.
- **DFS Method:** Recursively explores nodes, updates discovery and low values, and identifies bridges.
- **Main Method:** Builds the graph, runs DFS from each node, and returns the bridges.
